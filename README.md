### Abstract
This project focuses on automating the evaluation process of Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) sheets filled out by students during exams. Utilizing OpenCV, the system aims to accurately assess and score the responses marked on the OMR sheets. By leveraging image processing techniques, such as contour detection and template matching, the project aims to efficiently extract and analyze the marked answers. The objective is to streamline the assessment process, reducing manual labour and potential errors while providing educators with quick and accurate feedback on students' performance in exams.
